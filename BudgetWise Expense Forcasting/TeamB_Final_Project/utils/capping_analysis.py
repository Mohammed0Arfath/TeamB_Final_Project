print("1️⃣ Transaction Level:")
print("   • MAX_REALISTIC_TRANSACTION = ₹100,000 (₹1 lakh per transaction)")
print("   • MIN_REALISTIC_TRANSACTION = ₹1")

print("\n2️⃣ Daily Aggregation Level:")
print("   • MAX_REALISTIC_DAILY_EXPENSE = ₹50,000 (₹50k per day)")
print("   • This creates the flat ₹50,000 ceiling you see in dashboard")

print("\n🚨 Why the Dashboard Looks 'Fake':")
print("   • Original data has natural variation")
print("   • Preprocessing caps everything above ₹50k/day to exactly ₹50k")
print("   • Result: Flat, uniform ₹50k values instead of realistic peaks")
print("   • Average gets pulled up to ₹43,311 due to artificial ceiling")

print("\n💡 Solutions:")
print("   1. Remove daily capping entirely (most realistic)")
print("   2. Increase daily cap to ₹200,000+ (allow natural peaks)")
print("   3. Use percentile-based smoothing instead of hard caps")

print("\n📈 Expected Results After Fix:")
print("   • More natural data distribution") 
print("   • Realistic peaks and valleys in expense patterns")
print("   • Better model training with authentic data variance")
print("   • Dashboard shows genuine expense patterns")
